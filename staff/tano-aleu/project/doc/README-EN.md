## Intro

Synqple is a web application, whose main functionality is to synchronize live music, in an analogue way, i.e. without automatic synchronization. 

It will also allow the user to learn, understand and practice the synchronization of 2 or more sounds, with the possibility of making a song or a live Remix, from one or more mobile devices synchronized simultaneously and connected to audio devices (speakers, amplifiers, bluetooth speakers...).

Synqple brings a quick and easy way to synchronize audio, through an audio player, metronome, speed control, tap tempo, EQ and effects, that allow to play samples, loops and external audio in a synchronized way.

***(comes by default with a metronome, 17 Samples, 3 musical styles (breaks, reggae, house), 3 full harmonies Gmin, Emin, Bmin, these divided into 6 channels: drums, bass, guitar/piano, synth, percs, vocals)**.

#### Use Description


Move through the app, and discover its sections and functionalities,

once in the synqple(audio tool) section I recommend you to choose the first sample to test "Drum_1_Breaks", and follow the steps:

**(the BPM speed control is for both the metronome and the samples, the 2 sounds are started synchronously)** ** 1.


- 1. **Audio playback (metronome):** hit the play button and the metronome will play at a default speed of 120 bpm, also the sample just started playing **(only it is muted by default, you have to unmute it manually, but that can still wait)** you can change the bpm speed with the increase/decrease bpm buttons or with the tap to set the speed.

- 2. **Synchronisation:** For synchronisation you must use the TAP(synq), with 4 beats at the rhythm (of the music or instrument to be synchronised), marked from the beginning of the beat or loop to the end, 4 beats because synqple is intended for 4x4 music.

You will see that after 4 beats the value of the bpm control will change, showing the detected bpm. It is up to the user how accurate the sync is, for fine tuning use the bpm increment/decrement buttons in one unit and in the input range you can set it to 0.5. 

The beat nudge -/+ (moving the sample loop a little forward or backward) plays an essential role here because of the asynchrony or delay and the way synqple forces you to fully synchronise aurally, the beat nudge is essential in the synchronisation without it nothing could be synchronised.

- 3. **Audio playback (samples):** the idea is that the metronome is always completely synchronised first, once this is synchronised and it is re-checked several seconds aurally, the sample is unmuted.

- 4. **Sample volume control:** once the sample has been unmuted, the volume can be adjusted with the sample volume input range to achieve a balance between the music or instrument to be synchronised and the sample.

- 5. **Other functionalities:** You can change sample/loop by browsing the sample folder or using the favourites. You can also mute and unmute the metronome and samples independently. It has an allpass filter to play with the mixes. It also has a loop length that allows you to control the length of the sample loop, another fun way to play with the samples once they are synced.

-------------------


### Example:

- A song is playing, a musician or a band is playing and Synqple will allow you to:  

1. Synchronise a metronome manually.

2. Once the metronome is synced, you can mute it and launch samples/loops at the same speed as the metronome (samples/loops -> drums/synth/vocals...) from your smartphone or other device. 

3. Possibility of audio playback from a sound system parallel to the one that plays the song, musician or band or from the same sound system, that will depend on the possibility of audio connection.

### Another example (for React Native version): 

- Synqple can be used as a CD player or any other kind of Deejay player: 

1. Connect 2 devices to a DJ Mixer via audio (auxiliary cable).

2. Prepare your playlist to play on your device and make it accessible to Synqple.

3. Now you can play your tracks from your device or from another device.

4. You can proceed to use it like any other deejay audio player, as it has pitch, beat nudge and playback control, allowing you to mix 2 songs or as many as you want (with 2 or more devices connected analog to a djmixer with enough channels).
